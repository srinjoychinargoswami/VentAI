### Auto-Download Architecture
```dart
static Future<bool> initialize() async {
  if (await _isOllamaInstalled()) {
    _ollamaPath = await _findOllamaExecutablePath();
  } else {
    final installSuccess = await _autoInstallOllama();
    if (!installSuccess) return false;
  }
  return await startPersistentService();
